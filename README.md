# ETL Pipeline - Data Preprocessing, Transformation & Loading
This task was to create a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Pandas library. The goal was to build a professional data preprocessing system that can automatically clean, transform, and load data.
What I Did in This Task
1. Built the Main ETL Pipeline (etl_pipeline.py)
I created a comprehensive Python class called ETLPipeline with over 30 methods to handle all aspects of data processing:
Extract Functions:

Created methods to read data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, JSON files, and SQL databases
Made each method flexible with customizable parameters
Transform Functions:

Built functions to handle missing values using different strategies (mean, median, mode, drop, fill)
Created duplicate removal functionality
Implemented outlier detection and handling using IQR and Z-score methods
Added data normalization features (min-max and z-score)
Built categorical encoding (label encoding and one-hot encoding)
Created datetime feature extraction to get year, month, day, etc. from dates
Added support for custom transformation functions

Load Functions:

Developed methods to save data in multiple formats: CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases, and Parquet
Made each output format customizable

## Result

The final product is a **professional, production-ready ETL pipeline** that anyone can use to automate data cleaning and transformation tasks. It's well-documented, easy to use, and ready to be shared on GitHub or used in real-world projects.
